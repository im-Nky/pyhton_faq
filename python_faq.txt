1. Difference between list and tuples

List are mutable and tuples are Immutable

2. Genrators: Genrators are ways to implement Iterator

	Genrator Function: When it needs to genrate a value, It does so with 
			   the "yield keyword".

	Eg. def simple_genrator():
		yield 1
		yield 2
		yield 3

3. Decorators: Decorators are poweerful tool iin python, allows programmer to modify
	       the behavior of function or class.


	       Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the 
	       behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

		@gfg_decorators
		def hello():
			print("gfg")

4. Lambda Function: Lambda is inline function in python also known as anonymous function.


5. Packing and Unpacking: Whwn we don't know how many arguments need to be passed to a 
			python function. we can use packing to pack all arguments.


	*args  // To pack the list	* for tuples
					** for dictiories

	my_list = [1,2,3,4]
	fun(my_list)

6. "Self" Keyword : Self represent the instance of the class by using self we can access 
		    att and methods of class.

7. Namespace =: A name where it lives and can hooked for.

8. Dictionary : A dictionary is a collection which is unordered , chageable and indexed.

	thisdict = {
		"brand" : "Ford",
		"Model" : "Mustang",
		"Year"	: 1964
		}

9. List comprehension and slicing: It's way to define and create list in python.


10. PEP8: Coding convension , a set of recommendation to write more readable way.

11. Pickling and unpickling: Pickle module accepts any object and converts it into 
				string and dump it into a file using dump function.

	python is merged into 'private heap space'.
